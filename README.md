# 02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio # My First portfolio
## Introduction:

In this activity I've made a 3rd and final update to my  portfolio that I had started from scratch to showcase my  working skills and talents. For any potential employers that come across my portfolio looking to fill a position. I have provided the following information to my portfolio: The developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about myself and my work, and how to contact myself.
